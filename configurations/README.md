# IDS Rules
* [Cisco Talos Snort IDS Rules](rules/talos-snort.rules) - These are a handful of community rules that correspond to the SCADA Strangelove default credentials. More community rules are available [here](https://www.snort.org/downloads/community/community-rules.tar.gz)
* [Quickdraw Snort Signatures - v4.3.1](rules/quickdraw_4_3_1.zip) - The Quickdraw IDS signature download includes the Modbus TCP, DNP3, EtherNet/IP, and ICS Vulnerability signatures. Each category is in its own rules file, and Digital Bond recommends only adding the signatures appropriate for your control system. See the [pcap quickdraw](../pcaps/quickdraw/) section for test pcaps.

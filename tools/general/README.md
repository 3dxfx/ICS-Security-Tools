# ICS Tools - General
## Developed as a community asset at S4x16

## General
* [OpenSCADA](http://oscada.org/main/) - OpenSCADA system is an open implementation of SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) systems. The main properties of the system are: openness(GPL), multi-platform, modularity and scalability.
* [ModbusPal](http://modbuspal.sourceforge.net) - ModbusPal is a MODBUS slave simulator. Its purpose is to offer an easy to use interface with the capabilities to reproduce complex and realistic MODBUS environments.
* [IGSS Free 50](http://igss.schneider-electric.com/products/igss/download/free-scada.aspx) - IGSS FREE50 is a free edition of our flagship IGSS V11 (released May 2014) that is a full-featured SCADA System. Same functionality as the full offering, but is limited to setting up a project with no more than 50 objects.
* [OPCSystems.Net](https://www.opcsystems.com/downloads/downloads.php) - A wide variety of software available for time-limited trial use. SCADA, HMI, and OPC broadly covered.
* [AdvancedHMI](http://www.advancedhmi.com) - AdvancedHMI allows you to create HMI's. The software is based on the .NET framework and uses the popular Visual Studio as it's designer.

## Education Kits
* [CybatiWorks](https://cybati.org/cybatiworks-one) - Control system cybersecurity platform enabling entities to understand control system environments and cybersecurity risks. Engages the participant in understanding, enumerating, penetrating and mitigating the engineering workstation, HMI, OPC, Historian, PLC/PAC/IED/R(M)TU/DCS and protocol communications. Made up of three key components, 1) Virtualized operating system providing cyber offensive and defensive capabilities for ICS and IT environments, 2) Leveraging the Raspberry PI with PiFace Digital to represent a variety of control system devices (e.g. PLCs, PACs, MTU/RTU, DCS, Physical Security, and 3) Low voltage, kinetic I/O supporting models such as a traffic light, water treatment facility, bottling plant and assembly line.

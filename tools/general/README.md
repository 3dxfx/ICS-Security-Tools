# ICS Tools - General
## Developed as a community asset

## General
* [OpenSCADA (oscada)](http://oscada.org/main/) - OpenSCADA system is an open implementation of SCADA (Supervisory Control And Data Acquisition) and HMI (Human-Machine Interface) systems. The main properties of the system are: openness(GPL), multi-platform, modularity and scalability.
* [openSCADA](http://openscada.org) - openSCADA is the companion project to [Eclipse SCADA](https://eclipse.org/eclipsescada/). It provides additional components for the Eclipse SCADA system.
* [IGSS Free 50](http://igss.schneider-electric.com/products/igss/download/free-scada.aspx) - IGSS FREE50 is a free edition of IGSS V11 (released May 2014) that is a full-featured SCADA System. Same functionality as the full offering, but is limited to setting up a project with no more than 50 objects.
* [OPCSystems.Net](https://www.opcsystems.com/downloads/downloads.php) - A wide variety of software available for time-limited trial use. SCADA, HMI, and OPC broadly covered.
* [AdvancedHMI](http://www.advancedhmi.com) - AdvancedHMI allows you to create HMI's. The software is based on the .NET framework and uses the popular Visual Studio as it's designer.
* [ScadaBR](https://sourceforge.net/projects/scadabr/) - ScadaBR is a SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system with applications in Process Control and Automation, being developed and distributed using the open source model.
* [IndigoSCADA](http://www.enscada.com/a7khg9/IndigoSCADA.html) - A small footprint DCS - SCADA running on Linux and Windows. Development environment C/C++. HMI is based on QT library. Different technologies (EiC, GigaBASE, FastDB) have been integrated. OPC DA 2.05a, AE 1.10, HDA 1.20, DNP 3.0, RFC 1006, Modbus are supported.
* [OSHMI - Open Substation HMI](https://sourceforge.net/projects/oshmiopensubstationhmi/) - Full featured HMI used in production substations (Brazil).

## Education Kits
* [CybatiWorks](https://cybati.org/cybatiworks-one) - Control system cybersecurity platform enabling entities to understand control system environments and cybersecurity risks. Engages the participant in understanding, enumerating, penetrating and mitigating the engineering workstation, HMI, OPC, Historian, PLC/PAC/IED/R(M)TU/DCS and protocol communications. Made up of three key components, 1) Virtualized operating system providing cyber offensive and defensive capabilities for ICS and IT environments, 2) Leveraging the Raspberry PI with PiFace Digital to represent a variety of control system devices (e.g. PLCs, PACs, MTU/RTU, DCS, Physical Security, and 3) Low voltage, kinetic I/O supporting models such as a traffic light, water treatment facility, bottling plant and assembly line.
* [SamuraiSTFU](http://www.samuraistfu.org) - SamuraiSTFU takes the best in bread security tools for traditional network and web penetration testing, adds specialized tools for embedded and RF testing, and mixes in a healthy dose of energy sector context, documentation, and sample files. Including emulators for SCADA, Smart Meters, and other types of energy sector systems to provide leverage a full test lab.

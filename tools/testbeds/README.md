# ICS Testbed Tooling

Developed as a community asset

## Platforms

- [melody](https://github.com/iti/melody) - a TestBed which integrates Power System Simulation with Mininet to simulate a Micro Grid control Architecture. This TestBed was used for Anomaly Detection Purposes.
- [minimega](https://github.com/sandia-minimega/minimega) - minimega is a tool for launching and managing virtual machines.
- [NREL CEE](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/74142.pdf) - NRELâ€™s Cyber-Energy Emulation Platform for Research and System Visualization built upon Minimega and SCEPTRE.
- [SCEPTRE](https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1376989) - Sandia National Labs SCEPTRE provides a cyber-physical environment to analyze how cyber-initiated events affect the physical world.

## Systems

- [MiniCPS](https://github.com/scy-phy/minicps) - MiniCPS: a framework for Cyber-Physical Systems real-time simulation, built on top of mininet.
- [GRFICS](https://github.com/djformby/GRFICS) - GRFICS is a graphical realism framework for industrial control simulations that uses Unity 3D game engine graphics to lower the barrier to entry for industrial control system security. GRFICS provides users with a full virtual industrial control system (ICS) network to practice common attacks including command injection, man-in-the-middle, and buffer overflows, and visually see the impact of their attacks in the 3D visualization. Users can also practice their defensive skills by properly segmenting the network with strong firewall rules, or writing intrusion detection rules.
- [GRFICS v2](https://github.com/Fortiphyd/GRFICSv2) - GRFICS v2 is version 2 of the above package, organized as 5 Virtualbox VMs. There is also a commercial version of this now available.
- [Oil Pumpjack](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/oil-pumpjack) - Cisco-Talos repository contains all the materials to create your own oil pumpjack environment.

# ICS PCAPS
## Developed as a community asset

## Tools
* [CapSan](https://github.com/jsiwek/capsan) - Packet capture sanitizer/anonymizer for Jon Siwek at University of Illinois.

# Protocol Organized PCAPs
* [Jason Smith's Organized ICS PCAP repo](https://github.com/automayt/ICS-pcap) - A comprehensive collection of ICS/SCADA PCAPs organized by protocol. Make sure to have git lfs support and do a git lfs clone of the repo to get the actual files.

## Captures
* [Bro-IDS DNP3 & Modbus Captures](bro) - Test captures from the parser testing tree.
* [OpenICS test data](openics) - Test captures from the OpenICS effort.
* [Profinet Captures](profinet) - Random profinet captures from the wild
* [QuickDraw test data](quickdraw) - PCAPs from the quickdraw initiative to test the sensor filters.
* [Various DNP3 captures](dnp3) - This covers a variety of DNP3 captures broken out by function types. Includes some very obscure functionality and were designed for firewall testing.
* [Various Siemens S7 captures](https://github.com/gymgit/s7-pcaps) - Covers a subset of the S7 protocol, includes a few security critical functions such as authentication and firmware update.
* [Secure Water Treatment Testbed (SWaT/SUTD) Dataset](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/dataset/) - The SWaT Dataset was systematically generated from the Secure Water Treatment Testbed (SUTD) to address this need. The data collected from the testbed consists of 11 days of continuous operation. 7 days’ worth of data was collected under normal operation while 4 days’ worth of data was collected with attack scenarios.  During the data collection, all network traffic, sensor and actuator data were collected [available by request]
